    "description": "This Resource describes the delay defrost function as defined by the US Energy Star Specifications. See Energy Star Refrigerator Requirements Version 5 Section 4). (https://www. energystar. gov/sites/default/files/specs//private/ENERGY%20STAR%20Final%20Version%205. 0%20Residential%20Refrigerators%20and%20Freezers%20Program%20Requirements. pdf) The Property \"status\" is a boolean indicating whether the function is on, if off then defrost is scheduled as part of normal device operation. The Property \"startTime\" is an RFC3339 full-time encoded start time for the interval in which defrost shall not occur. The Property \"stopTime\" is an RFC3339 full-time encoded stop time for the interval in which defrost shall not occur. The Property \"interval\" with additional range restrictions is the time in minutes of the period that starts at starttime (if not present the default is 240). The Properties \"stopTime\" and \"interval\" are mutually exclusive; they cannot both be present in a Resource instance.",
