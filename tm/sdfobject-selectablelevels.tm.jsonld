For example where a humidifier has a discrete set that model different humidity levels that can be set. The Property \"availablelevels\" is an array of the levels that can be selected, these can be a number or an integer (as subset of integer). The Property \"targetlevel\" is the level that has currently been selected and is written to in order to select a new level. When retrieved the targetlevel provides the actual value that has been selected.",
